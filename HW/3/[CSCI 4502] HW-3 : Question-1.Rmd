# Question-1

### Part(a)

-> $lift(Bike, Ski) = \frac{\frac{600}{4000}}{\frac{2500}{4000} \cdot \frac{1300}{4000}} = 0.7384615$ \
-> Since lift(Bike, Ski) < 1, we can conclude Bike and Ski are negatively dependent. \

### Part(b)

-> Min. Support = 15% = 0.15 \
-> Min. Confidence = 40% = 0.4 \
-> Support = $\frac{600}{4000} = 0.15$ \
-> Support (0.15) = Min. Support (0.15) \
-> Confidence = $\frac{600}{1300} = 0.4615384$ \
-> Confidence (0.4615384) > Min. Confidence (0.4) \
-> Since the Support and Confidence both meet the threshold, we can conclude the association rule is strong. \
